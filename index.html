            I am a software engineer with a solid background in full-stack
            development and a passion for creating scalable, user-friendly
            applications. My technical expertise is complemented by significant
            experience in corporate leadership and business development,
            enabling me to align technology solutions with strategic goals. As a
            co-founder of <a href="https://nsschool.com.ua/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> New School of Science in Kyiv</a>,
             I managed a team of over 100, overseeing curriculum design, ICT development, strategic
            planning, and operational departments like compliance and
            accounting. I later led the Encyclopedia of Science School project
            in Riyadh, collaborating with government entities, conducting market
            research, and establishing robust operational frameworks. Both
            initiatives resulted in lasting, scalable organizations. My unique
            blend of technical and corporate expertise equips me to deliver
            impactful ICT projects that bridge business needs and technological
            innovation. As an IT Project Manager, I bring a proven track record
            of leadership, strategic execution, and delivering results at the
            intersection of technology and business. By the way, check out my
